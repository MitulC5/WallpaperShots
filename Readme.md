  <h3 align="center">WallpaperShots</h3>

  <p align="center">
    An android based social media application where content creators (photographers) upload photos which users can set as their wallpapers.
</p>

During my bachelor days many of my friends developed a passion for photography ( Some even turned out as professional photographers now) including myself. The story was simple. We clicked pictures and uploaded them on Instagram which were in a very weird aspect ratio and would get a few likes. We had many good photos but how do we share it in raw format to the masses.

So I came up with a solution. The plan was to develop an Application where these content creators uploaded photos added description and people would get a corousal of pictures which the user can easily set as their backgroung wallpaper. 

Here are some features:
* User can view the photos, read the descriptions.
* Content creators were selected by us so there were no problems with content moderation as I personally knew them.
* Portraits and Instagram are not that good friends. WallpaperShots excelled in any aspect ratio :smile:
